> Yet another way to attach bunyan to koa

If you find other modules that contain the keywords [bunyan](https://github.com/trentm/node-bunyan) and [koa](https://github.com/koajs/koa) then this module has almost certainly been influenced by them, thanks for all the hard work guys and gals!

npm run build
